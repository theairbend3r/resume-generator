## Problem Overview

Creating customized resumes are hard. To solve this, we've developed a webapp that takes in your information once and generates a resume in PDF format that you can download.

To create the resume in a step-by-step manner, we use the `react-albus` library. This provides the user with a wizard like experience. Apart from this, it also supports dynamic routing.

To generate a PDF file, we need server side processing. We chose NodeJS and ExpressJS for their speed, stability, and ease of integration with ReactJS. This allows us to offer a seamless application experience.

Our focus, to style the application, was on speed along with beautiful default options. We chose `styled-compnents` and `TailwindCSS`. `styled-components` allowed us to re-use a lot of code while `TailwindCSS` helped us to iterate faster over our designs. We use `Twin.macro` to get the best of both worlds.

## Technology Stack

### Frontend

The frontend is built using ReactJS. The app is bootstrapped using `create-react-app`. To style the app, we use `TailwindCSS`, `Styled Components`, and `Twin.macro`.

State management is achieved using `Context API` provided by `React`. It helps to maintain a global state which we utilize throughout the application.

API calls are managed using `axios` which makes it easy to send asynchronous HTTP requests to REST endpoints and perform CRUD operations.

`React-toastify` is used to display success/error messages to the user.

Finally, to create the multi-step form, we used `react-albus` developed by Amex.

### Backend

The backend is built using NodeJS and ExpressJS.
